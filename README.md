Exploratory Data Analysis Projects (EDA)

A data analystâ€™s job would be incomplete without EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). An EDA analyses the structure of data, allowing you to identify patterns and characteristics. Furthermore, they assist you in cleaning data, extracting important variables, identifying anomalies, and testing your underlying assumptions often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
